This document lists all markdown files that were removed during repository cleanup to eliminate redundancy and improve organization.

## Removed Files (16 total)

### Duplicate Exam Files (4 files)
- `00-basic-to-advanced/05-exam-simulation/EXAM_01.md` - Duplicate of `practice-exams/EXAM_01.md`

- `00-basic-to-advanced/05-exam-simulation/EXAM_04.md` - Duplicate of `practice-exams/EXAM_04.md`

**Reason**: These were duplicates. All practice exams are now consolidated in `practice-exams/` directory.

### Redundant Quick Start Guides (1 file)
- `CKA_QUICK_START.md` - Redundant with `QUICK_START_GUIDE.md`

**Reason**: `QUICK_START_GUIDE.md` is more comprehensive and up-to-date.

### Redundant Summary/Reference Files (3 files)
- `QUESTIONS_SUMMARY.md` - Information already in main README
- `PRACTICE_EXAM.md` - Redundant with `practice-exams/` folder
- `QUICK_REFERENCE.md` - Redundant with `KUBERNETES_CHEAT_SHEET.md` and `CHEAT_SHEET_ONE_PAGE.md`

**Reason**: Information is better organized in other files.

### Personal Tracking Files (5 files)

### Redundant Solution Files (2 files)

- `scenario-solutions/FIXES_APPLIED.md` - Temporary fix log
